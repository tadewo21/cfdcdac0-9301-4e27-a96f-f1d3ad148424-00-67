# Featured Job System - Complete Setup & Usage Instructions

## Overview
The Featured Job System allows employers to pay a premium fee (500 ETB) to give their job postings enhanced visibility and priority placement on the platform for 30 days.

## ðŸš€ Database Setup (REQUIRED)

Before using the system, you **MUST** run the database setup script:

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `featured_job_system_workflow_complete.sql`
4. Execute the script

This will create:
- `featured_job_requests` table for payment tracking
- Additional columns in `jobs` table (`is_featured`, `featured_until`)
- RLS policies for security
- Database functions for approval/rejection
- Storage bucket for payment screenshots

## ðŸ“‹ System Workflow

2. **Post Type Selection**: After form submission, employer chooses between:
   - **Free Post** (0 ETB) - Standard listing
   - **Featured Post** (500 ETB) - Premium listing with enhanced visibility

3. **Payment Process** (if Featured selected):
   - System displays payment instructions
   - Employer makes payment via bank/mobile banking
   - Employer enters transaction reference number
