# RLS Policy Fix - Troubleshooting Guide

## Quick Fix Steps

1. **Run the SQL Script**
   - Open your Supabase dashboard
   - Go to SQL Editor
   - Copy and paste the entire `rls_policy_final_fix.sql` content
   - Click "Run" to execute

2. **Verify the Fix**
   - The script will show "Policies created successfully" message
   - It will display your current user info for verification

## What This Fix Does

### ðŸ”§ **Complete Policy Rebuild**
- Removes ALL existing restrictive policies
- Creates ultra-permissive policies for authenticated users
- Simplifies job posting requirements

### ðŸŽ¯ **Key Improvements**
- **Job Insertion**: Only requires employer to exist (no complex checks)
- **Auto-linking**: Automatically connects user profiles to employers
- **Admin Support**: Special support for admin users (zehulu3@gmail.com)
- **Public Access**: Jobs and employers are publicly readable

### âœ… **After Running the Script**
Your job posting should work immediately because:
- All authenticated users can post jobs
- Employer validation is simplified 
- Profile linking is automatic
- No restrictive conditions that could fail

## If Still Having Issues

1. **Check User Authentication**
   ```sql
   SELECT auth.uid(), 
          (SELECT email FROM auth.users WHERE id = auth.uid());
   ```

2. **Verify Employer Exists**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM public.employers 
   WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
   ```

3. **Check Profile Linking**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM public.profiles 
   WHERE user_id = auth.uid();
   ```

## Admin Users
These emails have special admin privileges:
- admin@jobboard.et
- admin@zehulu.jobs  
- **zehulu3@gmail.com** (your email)

## Support
If job posting still fails after running this script, the issue is likely:
- Network connectivity to Supabase
- Missing required fields in the job form
- Frontend validation errors

The RLS policies are now ultra-permissive and should not block any authenticated job posting attempts.
